# Simon Says Game 🟢🔴🔵🟡

**Simon Says Game** is a fun browser-based memory challenge in which players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Start the Game** – press a button or hit any key to begin.
2. **Watch & Remember** – the game generates a random color sequence. Each step lights up a colored button and plays a tone.
3. **Your Turn** – replicate the sequence by clicking on the color buttons in the correct order.
4. **Progression** – if you succeed, the sequence grows by one for the next round.
5. **Game Over** – a mistake ends the game. The background may flash red, and your final score is displayed. You can restart the game anytime.
